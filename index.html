        <p>Dear Abuelita,</p>

        <p>Hey! I hope everything’s going well. I’m working on a project for my religion class and they asked me to reflect on my faith journey, so I thought I'd write this to you. I always feel good talking to you about this stuff.</p>

        <p>When I think about religion in general, I guess it’s about finding a purpose and a group of people you feel comfortable with. There are rules, stories, and things people do together. My faith is a little different, though. For me, it's not so much about going to church or following all the rules exactly, but more about <span class="important-words">feeling connected to something bigger</span> than me.</p>

        <p>A couple of things that have become super important to me are <span class="important-words">gratitude</span> and being <span class="important-words">kind</span>. I’ve realized that life is kind of a gift, and trying to be thankful for the little things—like a cool sunset or a good song—helps me feel closer to whatever faith is. I also think how we treat others really matters; for me, that's the most important part of my faith.</p>

        <p>Since I really value being kind and grateful, I'm going to make a <span class="important-words">conscious effort to be kinder</span> to the people around me. I think that by doing that, my faith will get stronger and it'll help me be a better person. It doesn't have to be anything huge, even just a small act of kindness every day is enough.</p>

        <p>Anyway, thanks for reading. Talk to you soon!</p>
