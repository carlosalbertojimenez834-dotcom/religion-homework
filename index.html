                <p><strong>Dear Grandma,</strong></p>
                <p class="mb-6">I wanted to tell you about a thought I've been having for a school assignment. I was asked to reflect on my faith journey, and I realized how much it's changed from when I was a kid to now. I thought it would be interesting to share it with you.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">1. As a child: My family’s faith</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">When I was little, my faith was pretty simple. We went to church, celebrated the holidays, and I learned the Bible stories. It was something we did as a family, part of our routine, like just another tradition. Honestly, I didn't think much about it. To me, faith was something I was just given, not something I had chosen. It was something that united my family, and I didn't question why we did it.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">My beliefs back then were basically a reflection of what my parents had taught me and what I saw around me. There was no personal connection, it was more like knowledge we had. Faith was a practice, something you did because it was the norm in my house, and I thought it was that way for everyone.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">2. High school: Who am I?</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">As I got older, everything started to change. In high school, seeing that my friends came from different backgrounds and had their own beliefs, I started questioning mine. It wasn't enough to just follow traditions anymore; I wanted to know why I believed what I believed.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">It was a little bit of a confusing time, like my faith was going through a kind of a reboot. What I had been told was no longer enough; I had to find my own answers. I started exploring, reading, and thinking more about what I truly believed, and how it all fit into my life. In this process, my relationship with faith became much more personal. I stopped seeing it as a simple tradition and started to consider it a fundamental part of who I am.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">3. The future: What I hope for my faith</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Thinking about the future, I see my faith as something that will guide me in the coming years. I hope it's a source of strength that helps me find my way and become a better person. I want it to influence my decisions and how I treat others, to help me be more compassionate.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">I don't know exactly how it will show up in the future, but what I do know is that it won't be the same as it was when I was a kid. It will be something I have chosen, something I've worked on, and something that will continue to grow with me. It will be a guide that helps me live in a more authentic way and connect with something bigger than myself.</p>

                <p class="text-right mt-6">With love,</p>
